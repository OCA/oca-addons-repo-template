    write "server-tools" here.

  type: yaml
  default: []
  help: >
    If you need to activate extra apt sources in Travis, this is the place. It must be a
    YAML list with aliases listed here:
    https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-source-safelist/blob/master/ubuntu.json.

    Example: [heroku, mono]

  default: []
  help: >
    Are there in this repo modules that don't get along with their friends? If so, list
    them here (YAML format) and they will be tested in separate jobs.

    Beware, if rebel modules should stay separated in groups, you should join them with
    commas, which could be misinterpreted by YAML.

    Example: ["rebel_module_1,rebel_module_2", even_more_rebel_module]
