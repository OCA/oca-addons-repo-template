  type: yaml
  default: []
  help: >
    If you need to activate extra apt sources in Travis, this is the place. It must be a
    YAML list with aliases listed here:
    https://github.com/travis-ci/apt-source-safelist/blob/master/ubuntu.json.

    Example: [heroku, mono]

    Are there in this repo modules that don't get along with their friends? If so, list
